# password-generator
For this homework assignment, we had to create a random password generator. The user
is asked to input the desired length of the password (from 8 to 128). Then, the user is asked to confirm whether they want to include 4 different criteria: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The password is then generated from the selected criteria with the desired length.

## Technologies Used
Javascript was used to build this generator in Visual Studio, using Terminal to access the Github repo with git. The HTML/CSS was provided for us.
